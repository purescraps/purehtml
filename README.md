# PureHTML: Parsing specification for extracting JSON from HTML

This is the TypeScript/JavaScript implementation of the PureHTML specification.

You need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) first, then follow the steps explained in the documentation.

See [https://purescraps.github.io/purehtml/](https://purescraps.github.io/purehtml/) for documentation and playground.

### IDE Support

You may use [yaml-language-server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server) for autocompletions.

Add this line to top of your yaml:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=typescript/src/config-schema.json
```

For [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you may install [YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml).
